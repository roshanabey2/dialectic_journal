<h2> Dialectic Journal </h2>

Dialectic Journal is a Bullet Journal (BJ) and Zettelkasten-inspired note-taking (ZN) application, powered by an LLM chatbot. The chatbot structures user messages into notes and organizes them into either the Zettelkasten knowledge system or the Bullet Journal, depending on the content.

<h3>User Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>As a user</strong>, I want a <strong>single application for my daily organization/planning as well as note-taking</strong>, so I don’t have to switch between multiple apps while working, learning, or planning.</li>
<li> <strong>As a user</strong>, I want to input information into a <strong>universal chat function</strong> so that planning and note-taking feel quick and easy.</li>
<li> <strong>As a user</strong>, I want an LLM-powered AI to <strong>automatically classify </strong> my messages as either <strong>Zettelkasten notes</strong> or <strong>Bullet Journal entries</strong>, so I don’t have to sort them manually.</li>
<li><strong>As a user</strong>, I want to have <strong>continuous conversations <italic>(a Dialectic)</italic> with the AI</strong>, which can break down and <strong> summarize</strong> discussions into <strong>notes, a set of notes, or structured plans</strong>, so note-taking and planning feel as natural as a conversation. </li>
<li><strong>As a user</strong>, I want the AI to <strong>format</strong> notes from dialogue into <strong>bullet points or atomic sentences</strong>, so my ideas, reminders, goals, and questions are clear..</li>
<li><strong>As a user</strong>, I want to see and <strong>edit the note in real time</strong> as it is generated, so I can manually adjust its formatting or content if needed. </li>
<li> <strong>As a user</strong>, I want the AI to <strong>identify and save the topic</strong> of each note, ensuring conceptual clarity of my thoughts.</li>
<li> <strong> As a user</strong>, I want the AI to organize topics hierarchically into <strong>meta-topic → topic → sub-topic</strong>, so I can better structure my knowledge. </li>
<li> <strong>As a user</strong>, I want to visualize my topics and their relationships as a <strong> knowledge tree or mind map</strong>, so I can see how my ideas are interconnected.</li>
<li> <strong>As a user</strong>, I want to <strong>toggle</strong> between viewing atomic bullet points or full notes under each topic in the mind map/knowledge tree, so I can control the level of detail displayed </li>
<li><strong> As a user</strong>, I want to <strong>trace</strong> each note or bullet point <strong>back to the conversation</strong> it originated from, so I understand its context and genesis. </li>
<li><strong>As a user</strong>, I want to see all planning/organizational items extracted from conversations in a <strong> day-to-day Bullet Journal view</strong>, so I can easily track my tasks.
